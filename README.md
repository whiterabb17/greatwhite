GreatWhite / Necromancy
Some musing into developing a simple multi-os reverse trojan built entirely (mostly) using Golang including the GUI (although a golang port of electron).
Features such as stable multi-os command execution and password recovery for chromium browsers.

I am releasing this publicly for entirely education purposes.
Due to that reason i have purposefully bugged certain parts of the GUI as to stop skiddies from abusing this code.
As well as defanged the client and removed the recovery modules, again to stop skids from recklessness.
